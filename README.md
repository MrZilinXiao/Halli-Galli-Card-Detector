Welcome to my blog page to see how I bulid such a detector in Chinese:[https://mrxiao.net/CV-Halli-Galli-Card-Detector.html ](https://mrxiao.net/CV-Halli-Galli-Card-Detector.html  "https://mrxiao.net/CV-Halli-Galli-Card-Detector.html ")


## Self introduction
A Card Detector Program using OpenCV-Python, could easily beat human in the board game Halli Galli.
## Instructions

Need Numpy and python-opencv packages.
## Demostrations
